## Context

For this project we wanted to create the next location of ALGOSUP into a fully immersive experience thanks to the VR[^5] technology, it should be used by the people who wants to discover what is a day at ALGOSUP

## Goals

The goal for this project is to have the most immersive and complete experience with all the features we wanted,

## MVP

The actual Minimum Viable Product is a simple simulation of the B3[^3] where the user can walk into it

## Out of scope

- Fully usable on all VR[^5] device
- Interract with the NPC[^4] by the voice
- Make multi-users simulation

<!-- ## Technologies Used

[.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/)

[Unity](https://unity.com/)

[GitHub](https://github.com/TheoDct/ALGOSUP_2022_Project_4_D/tree/main) -->

## Ressources

For this project, the architect give us a 3d file in .ifc[^6] of the building and a 2d plan in .pdf[^7]

To try the simulation all along the project we have been provided with the virtual reality headsets : Oculus Quest 2[^5]

## Technologies Used

We will use these softwares to achieve the project :

Unity[^8] :

- Pro Builder[^9]
- Netcode[^10]
- Relay[^11]
- Lobby[^12]
- Vivox[^13]

Visual Studio[^14]

Git[^15]

CAD Exchanger[^16]

<!-- ## .NET Version

6.0

We used this version because it's the last version of .NET and we wanted to use something up-to-date -->

## Unity Version

2020.3.29f1

We used this version because it's the last LTS[^2] version in order to have the best stability throughout the project.

### Templates of project unity

We decided to use the template URP[^1] because it will simplify the rendering at the end of the project, it will also allow us to use a Graphic tool to program shaders in order to have better graphics and effects in the simulation.

## Device compatibility

VR headset :

- Oculus Quest[^4]
- Oculus Quest 2
