It's a school project made by the demand of [ALGOSUP](https://www.algosup.com/index.html)

## Requirement

In order to help people who want to go to ALGOSUP, we needed to create a tool to let them visit the building in VR[^1], we thought about the best way to make it, and we think a simulation made with unity was the most optimal way to respond to this problem.

## Objectives 

The objectives of the project is to put the next ALGOSUP building in a VR[^1] simulation.

The final product must be able to have the most optimal experience for someone who want to have a preview of a day in ALGOSUP and who have a VR headsets.

## Possible change requests 

Actually we have nothing we need to change by what we imagine.

## Targeted audience 

Our targeted audience is mainly supposed to be used by people who want to discover how.

## MVP

The Minimum Viable Product must be capable of move in the VR[^1] into the Building and interact with the main objects like the doors.

## The final product 

Ideally, the final product should have all the features we needed first like : 
- access control to some rooms 
- room usage 
- circulation of NPC[^2] identified as students 
- Furniture 
- Storage 
- Plugs 

with all of this we think we could possibly make the best possible experience for someone who want to discover the building via VR[^1].
